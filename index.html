                Érable is "Yet Another Semantic HTML Minimalistic CSS"
                (YASHTMLMCSS, or YASHMC for besties). This serves the purpose
                of effortlessly outputting a nice layout for a simple website.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point of this tool (or this <em>css file</em>) existing is to provide an extremely
                lightweight stylesheet for blazing fast websites, while at the
                same time keeping an aesthetic of the good ol' days of the Internet.

            <p>
                My name is
                <a href="https://dlgiovani.dev" target="_blank">
                    Giovani</a>, and I am a fullstack (backend that needs to get paid)
                programmer. I learned React and many other tools just so I
                could build state-of-the-art websites in today's dynamic world.
            </p>
            <p>
                As any dev that came from C++ roots, I hate the current webstack.
                And I say this being a huge fan of web applications! Why do I need
                fancy stateful websites with hydration and optimized rendering everytime?
                Sometimes all we need is a good structured website that is easy to build
                and easy to read; that works well with SEO and gets the job done.
            </p>
            <p>
                A website built directly in HTML with good semantics has lots of benefits:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>It loads fast</li>
                <li>Easy to build</li>
                <li>It feels more personal</li>
                <li>Great for accessibility</li>
                <li>Gives a great feeling of nostalgia</li>
                <li>It actually makes you feel superior
                    <img src="https://media.tenor.com/f752Wkttd_IAAAAi/xd.gif" alt="Cool sunglasses emoji" height="40">
                </li>
                <li>Ok, I am joking about the last one</li>
                <li>Maybe</li>
            </ol>
            <hr />
            <p>
                Now, of course, there are plenty of other similar (I am lying, this is actually
                scarcer than I thought) frameworks out there, like
                <a href="https://picocss.com/" target="_blank">
                    Pico</a>,
                that works fine. So why should I use Érable?
            </p>
            <p>
                First, to say that you <em>should</em> use it, I won't.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    This is something to inspire the growth of a movement for a more democratic
                    and personal Internet.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the last months (as of Oct. 1st, 2025) I've seen many people
                online talking about two things:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PewDiePie/search?query=linux" target="_blank">
                        Linux (and open source software)</a>
                    <!--
                        (I use Arch btw)
                    -->
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0RqucKwIcw&list=PLylbDrm65cZ3AM1XrUsZeajuNQ6iNw1K2"
                        target="_blank">
                        A more democratic and personal Internet
                    </a>

            </ol>
            <p>
                and this is ACTUALLY HUGE. We may be witnessing a huge shift in the biggest
                communitary space on Earth (the Internet, if you didn't get it).
            </p>
            <p>
                I heavily recommend that you watch the videos anchored above (I know that
                YouTube kinda sucks for most people nowadays, but it's worth it).
            </p>
            <p>
                Basically the message we want to spread is: the Internet is not
                some place to just consume stuff that big corporations build so
                they can make a huge profit while you rot your brain;
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>
                    <strong>
                        THE INTERNET IS A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN BUILD AND SHARE YOUR
                        OWN WORLD, FOR FREE, WITH ANYONE.
                    </strong>
                    And then, logically, connect with other people who do the same.

            <h2>Tutorial</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>The &lt;main&gt; tag</h3>
                <p>
                    All the sections inside the tag "main" will be placed in the left column
                    if you have an aside tag. Center (the only possible column) otherwise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main content will be followed by a line in the right margin.
                </p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>The &lt;aside&gt; tag</h3>
                <p>
                    This will produce the aside in the right column by default.
                    If not present, the column will not be rendered.
                    Pretty clever trick with the :has() selector in CSS!
                </p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>The theme selector</h3>
                <p>
                    The theme selector is made with pure CSS. And
                    <strong>it gets better:</strong> change the data-theme
                    in the HTML tag (press f12) to 'dark', as in: <br />
                    <code>&lt;html data-theme="dark"&gt;</code> <br />
                    Now it will be dark, <em>and if you check the toggle theme input,
                        it will render the light theme!</em>
                    THIS IS STILL PURE CSS! It is a clever trick I found with
                    selectors,

                <h3>Tables</h3>
                <p>
                    As Érable is still in its pre-alpha version, it's pretty simple.
                    It will always be pretty simple, but surely more tags will be
                    styled in the future. The &lt;table&gt; tag and its children are styled
                    with nice collapsed borders and coloring for caption and footer.
